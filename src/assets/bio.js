	intro:
    "My name is Chelsea Angelena Brown. I write code and build applications for web and mobile devices. I am a full stack developer, working on both the front end UI/UX interfaces, as well as building and connecting a back-end server and database.The tech stack that I primarily work with to achieve this is JavaScript, React and React-Native for front end development, and Node.js/Express.js for the server-side. I also use CSS/SCSS and javascript components for styling. I am always trying to learn new things and adapt to different technologies, so this changes depending upon the application I am buidling. I have recently graduated from BrainStation's web development diploma program, in August 2020. In projects section you can find links to my school projects, and the projects features are projects that I have built since the course. All of the source code is available through my github account, and each project is linked to a demo or url. I'm always trying to learn new things and grow as a developer. If you're interested in collaberting, or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.",
