		 "Prior to attending BrainStation's Web Develeopment Bootcamp in May of 2020, I had been working for an e-commerce site, which is where my interest in learning to code developed. I started to learn a little bit online with FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy, but it wasn't until bootcamp that I really became immersed. Our instructor, Jon, was an awesome teacher, and I am still amazed by how much we learned in only twelve weeks. Since the program I have been coding daily and working on side projects for mobile development with React-Native.",
